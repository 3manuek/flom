.SH NAME
flom \- serialize command execution
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "flom"
[\fIOPTION\fP] -- [\fICOMMAND\fP [\fIARG\fP]...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Run COMMAND serializing it with other commands executed by flom.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 4
.B "-h, --help"
show help options
.TP
.B -v, --version
print flom version and exit
.TP
.B -V, --verbose
verbose mode execution
.TP
.B -c, --config-file=\fIFILENAME
user configuration file name. Flom tries to read system default configuration file @sysconfdir@/@_SYSTEM_CONFIG_FILENAME@, user default configuration file ~/@_USER_CONFIG_FILENAME@ and finally this file if specified. Definitive configuration is obtained overloading hard wired build time defaults, system defaults, user defaults, user custom, command line options.
.TP
.B -r, --resource-name=\fIRESOURCE
name of the resource used for enqueing (locking). Resource name can be composed of "alpha" and "digit" characters, but the first character \fBmust be\fP of type "alpha" (example: "RA123" is \fBOK\fP, "123RA" is \fBnot\fP OK). Accepted resource names are described in function "global_res_name_preg_init": inspect source code for more details.
.TP
.B -w, --resource-wait=\fIyes|no
\fBdefault\fP (\fIyes\fP): the command will enqueue if the resource is already locked by someone else, otherwise (\fIno\fP) it will return immediately
.TP
.B -o, --resource-timeout=\fImilliseconds
maximum enqueue time if the resource is already locked by someone else; if the resource doesn't become free before \fItimeout milliseconds\fP the command will return. Note: "\fI-o 0\fP" is equivalent to "\fI-w no\fP"
.TP
.B -l, --lock-mode=\fIMODE
lock mode as defined by VMS DLM (Distributed Lock Manager). \fIMODE\fP can be: "NullLock", "ConcurrentRead", "ConcurrentWrite", "ProtectedRead", "ProtectedWrite", "Exclusive" (equivalent short forms are: "NL", "CR", "CW", "PR", "PW", "EX"). More information are available here \fIhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_lock_manager#Lock_modes\fP
.TP
.B -T, --command-trace-file=\fIFILENAME
file destination of the trace messages produced by the command (foreground) process; \fIFILENAME\fP must be an absolute path. \fBFLOM_TRACE_MASK\fP environment variable must be set with an active bit for every desired module.
.TP
.B -t, --daemon-trace-file=\fIFILENAME
file destination of the trace messages produced by the daemon (background) process; \fIFILENAME\fP must be an absolute path. \fBFLOM_TRACE_MASK\fP environment variable must be set with an active bit for every desired module.
.TP
.SH EXIT STATUS
if anything runs as expected, \fBflom\fP exit status is the same of the controlled (serialized) command. Sometimes an error occurs and \fBflom\fP reports it using dedicated exit statuses you can check with \fI$?\fP environment variable:
.P
\fB@_ES_UNABLE_TO_EXECUTE_COMMAND@:\fP \fBflom\fP caught an error trying to exec (see \fIexecvp\fP man page) COMMAND
.P
\fB@_ES_RESOURCE_BUSY@:\fP the resource can \fBnot\fP be locked because it's already locked by someone else (have you used \fB--resource-wait=no\fP option?!)
.P
\fB@_ES_GENERIC_ERROR@:\fP \fBflom\fP caught some type of error and did not execute COMMAND
.P
.SH EXAMPLES
See web page \fIhttp://sourceforge.net/p/flom/wiki/FLOM%20by%20examples/\fP for a detailed list of use cases
.P
.SH CAVEATS
.B flom -- flom --
[COMMAND [ARG]...]
.P
hangs due to a deadlock: the inner flom instance waits the lock obtained by the first flom instance.
