	FLOM, Free LOck Manager, a free and open source lock manager

FLOM (Free LOck Manager) is an open source and free lock manager designed to
serialize ans synchronize shell command execution.

A list of well known use cases are listed at this URL: 
http://sourceforge.net/p/flom/wiki/FLOM%20by%20examples/
This is a brief list of the available features:
- synchronization of shell commands to avoid conflicts on files, directories,
  abstract resources
- enforcement of command order execution to avoid one command is executed
  before another one
- resource utilization leveling to avoid too many similar tasks run at the
  same time 
- all the synchronization features are available inside a single host or in
  a distributed environment using TCP/IP networking
- an autodiscovery feature is available to reduce deployment complexity in a
  distributed environment (every node at any time may become a "server" for
  the others node)

Install FLOM using standard GNU build chain: 
tar xvzf flom-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
cd flom-X.Y.Z
./configure
make
sudo make install
refer to INSTALL file for more details.

Use 
man flom 
to read man page and pick up Internet relevant URLs for FLOM project.

Use
make check
to perform package automatic tests.
NOTE: do *NOT* run tests on a system that's using flom because some tests
      need to kill all flom running instances and this is not acceptable if
      you are playing production workloads. DO USE A TEST SYSTEM!
NOTE: tests needs the system is NOT overloaded because they stick on timing
      and timing breaks if the system is overloaded.

If you need some help (usage tricks, hints, etc...) please post a message in
the forum: http://sourceforge.net/p/flom/discussion/
If you think you have discovered a bug, please open a ticket here:
http://sourceforge.net/p/flom/tickets/
If you avoided to send me an e-mail I would be happy: forum posts and tickets
can be seen by many people and I should not answer the same questions many
times.

Enjoy flom!
