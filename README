Use 
man flom 
to read man page and pick up Internet relevant URLs for FLOM project.

Use
make check
to perform package automatic tests.
NOTE: do *NOT* run tests on a system that's using flom because some tests
      need to kill all flom running instances and this is not acceptable if
      you are playing production workloads. DO USE A TEST SYSTEM!
NOTE: tests needs the system is NOT overloaded because they stick on timing
      and timing breaks if the system is overloaded.
Enjoy it!
