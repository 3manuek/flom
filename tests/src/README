The C source files contained in this directory are used as test cases for
libflom (flom library) usage and can be used as programming examples.
Makefile automatically compiles them; if you want to compile one of these
examples for your own purpose, you shall use a command like the following one
(the example referes to "case0000.c" source program):

gcc -I /usr/local/include/ $(pkg-config --cflags glib-2.0) \
	-L /usr/local/lib/ -l flom $(pkg-config --libs glib-2.0 gthread-2.0) \
	-o case0000 case0000.c

Note:
0. you must install flom (sudo make install) before starting to build your own
   program using libflom
1. /usr/local/include is the default installation path of libflom headers
   (change it according to your configuration if you changed the default)
2. /usr/local/lib is the default installation path of libflom library
   (change it according to your configuration if you changed the default)
3. glib-2.0 and gthread-2.0 compile and link flags are retrieved using
   pkg-config utility
