Daemon lifespan truth table

unic	multic	lifesp	behavior
null	null	<0	no networking, daemon will never end
null	null	0	no networking, daemon will NOT be started by this
			command
null	null	>0	no networking, daemon will die after lifespan inactivity
			time
null	value	<0	use multicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			a new instance will be activated locally; activated
			daemon will never end
null	value	0	use multicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			no new instance will be activated locally: an error
			will be reported
null	value	>0	use multicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			a new instance will be activated locally; activated
			daemon will die after lifespan inactivity time
value	null	<0	use unicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			a new instance will be started locally, but it can be
			activated only if unicast address is a valid address
			for the current host; activated daemon will never end
value	null	0	use unicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			no new instance will be activated locally: an error
			will be reported
value	null	>0	use unicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			a new instance will be started locally, but it can be
			activated only if unicast address is a valid address
			for the current host; activated daemon will die after
			lifespan inactivity time
value	value	<0	use unicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			a new instance will be started locally, but it can be
			activated only if unicast address is a valid address
			for the current host; multicast address will be used
			to answer other commands looking for the daemon using
			multicast address (null, value, 0); activated daemon 
			will never end
value	value	=0	use unicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			no new instance will be activated locally: an error 
			will be reported. "multicast" option is ignored, the
			same behavior of (value, null, 0)
value	value	>0	use unicast to reach daemon, if there is no answer
			a new instance will be started locally, but it can be
			activated only if unicast address is a valid address
			for the current host; multicast address will be used
			to answer other commands looking for the daemon using
			multicast address (null, value, 0); activated daemon 
			will die after lifespan inactivity time
