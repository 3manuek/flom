Road map:

implement Use Case 16 (7/8 and 8/8 for simple and hierarchical resources)
add autodiscovery to Use Case 16

check "resource create" with every type of resource... :)

put inside function flom_accept_loop_chklockers a check if the thread associated to the locker is really active; it the thread leaved (due to an error), make a clean-up phase. This avoid a daemon crash after a thread terminated with an error, but listener thread has a "locker object" already active

implement FIFO, LIFO, FIRST FIT (for numerical resources) lock allocation policies

intercept kill signal from daemon and try to terminate gracefully
