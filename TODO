Road map:

put a flag in build procedure to avoid library fixed path at build time:
flom_LDFLAGS = -Wl,-rpath -Wl,$(libdir)
must can be avoided by power user

client library

IPv6

SSL 

Java (client)

sequences

transactional sequences (no holes sequences)

put inside function flom_accept_loop_chklockers a check if the thread associated to the locker is really active; it the thread leaved (due to an error), make a clean-up phase. This avoid a daemon crash after a thread terminated with an error, but listener thread has a "locker object" already active

implement FIFO, LIFO, FIRST FIT (for numerical resources) lock allocation policies
