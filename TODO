Road map:

implementing signals... intercept signal condition in locker as well as in
main thread

document termination modes:
SIGTERM: quiesce
SIGINT: immediate
SIGQUIT: default behavior

put inside function flom_accept_loop_chklockers a check if the thread associated to the locker is really active; it the thread leaved (due to an error), make a clean-up phase. This avoid a daemon crash after a thread terminated with an error, but listener thread has a "locker object" already active

implement FIFO, LIFO, FIRST FIT (for numerical resources) lock allocation policies
