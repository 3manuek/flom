Road map:

implement graceful shutdown with a message sent by client to server; signal handling is not a good choice because the process is threaded and every syscall could potentially receive EINTR. Leaving default signal behavior

put inside function flom_accept_loop_chklockers a check if the thread associated to the locker is really active; it the thread leaved (due to an error), make a clean-up phase. This avoid a daemon crash after a thread terminated with an error, but listener thread has a "locker object" already active

implement FIFO, LIFO, FIRST FIT (for numerical resources) lock allocation policies

IPv6
